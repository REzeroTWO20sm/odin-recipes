		<p>First thing first, the word sushi actually means “sour rice” in Japanese. To make great sushi, you need to start with the rice. We first cook Japanese short-grain rice and then season it with sweetened vinegar. Once the rice cools just slightly, we’ll shape it to make sushi.</p>
		<p>Depending on the style of sushi, it can be topped or filled with a variety of ingredients such as seafood (both raw and cooked) and vegetables.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sushi Rice</li>
			<li>Nori</li>
			<li>Seafood</li>
			<li>Vegetables</li>
			<li>Wasabi, Soy souce, Ginger</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li>Follow my Sushi rice recipe to cook the rice and season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and kosher salt. Cover with a damp cloth at all times to prevent drying.</li>
			<li>Prepare the fillings. Cut the cucumber and tuna lengthwise into long strips. Season the natto (fermented soybean) with soy sauce or the natto seasoning packet. Stir several times.</li>
			<li>Make the tezu (finger-dipping vinegar water) with water and rice vinegar.</li>
			<li>Prepare the nori (dried laver seaweed). Cut the longer side of the nori sheet in half and store in an airtight bag until ready to use.</li>
			<li>Place the sushi mat on the work surface so the bamboo slats run sideways (horizontally). Place a nori half sheet shiny side down on the mat.</li>
			<li>Moisten your hand with tezu, then scoop the sushi rice into your hand. Spread the rice evenly on the nori with both fingers, keeping a 1-inch space across the top.</li>
			<li>Add one filling of your choice (tuna, cucumber, or natto) across the middle of the rice. Hold the filling down using your fingers.</li>
			<li>Roll the nori and rice over the filling with one swift movement. Gently shape and tighten the roll from outside the mat. Move the roll to a tray and keep it covered with a damp cloth/plastic wrap to prevent drying. Make the rest of the rolls.</li>
		</ol>
