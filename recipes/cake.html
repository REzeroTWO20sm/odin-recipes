		<p>To prepare the fruit: Combine the fruit with the liquid of your choice in a non-reactive bowl; cover and let rest overnight Too impatient to wait until tomorrow? Microwave everything for 1 minute (or until it's very hot), cover, and let rest 1 hour.</p>
		<p>Preheat the oven to 300Â°F. This recipe makes enough batter for ONE (not all!) of the following: 3 dozen individual (muffin pan) cakes; 16 mini loaves (about 3 3/4" x 2 1/2"); 6 to 8 medium loaves (about 3" x 5"); or 2 standard 9" x 5" loaves. Choose your pans (or combinations), and lightly grease them. If you're making muffin-size cakes in a standard muffin pan, line the pan with muffin papers, and lightly grease the papers.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups (213g) dried pineapple, diced</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups (255g) raisins, golden or regular</li>
			<li>1 cup (128g) dried apricots, diced</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups (223g) dates, chopped</li>
			<li>heaping 1 cup (170g) candied red cherries, plus additional for decoration, if desired</li>
			<li>1/3 cup (64g) crystallized ginger, diced, optional</li>
			<li>3/4 cup (170g) rum, brandy, apple juice, or cranberry juice</li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li>To make the batter: Place the butter and sugar in a large bowl (at least 6-quart), and beat together until well combined.</li>
			<li>Beat in the salt, spices, and baking powder.</li>
			<li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition.</li>
			<li>In a separate bowl whisk together the flour and cocoa.</li>
			<li>Add the flour mixture and the syrup (or boiled cider) to the mixture in the bowl, beating gently to combine.</li>
			<li>Stir in the juice or water, then the fruit (including any additional liquid that has collected in the bowl), and the nuts. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, and stir until everything is well combined.</li>
			<li>Spoon the batter into the pans, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>
			<li>Bake the cakes on the middle shelf of the oven, as follows: about 60 minutes for the individual cakes; 65 to 70 minutes for the small loaves; 75 minutes for the medium loaves, and 2 hours + 10 to 15 minutes for the 9" x 5" loaves. The cakes are done when a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
			<li>Remove the cakes from the oven. Fruitcake can remain in its pan for storage, if desired. Or carefully remove cake from the pan after about 5 minutes, loosening its edges first.</li>
			<li>Brush the warm cake with rum, brandy, simple syrup, or flavored simple syrup (vanilla, rum-flavored, etc.). If you like just a hint of rum or brandy flavor, add 1 tablespoon of liquor to 3/4 cup vanilla syrup or simple syrup, and brush this mixture on the cakes. (This keeps them moist for weeks; you can skip this step, but they won't stay moist long-term.)</li>
			<li>When the cakes are completely cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, and store at room temperature for up to 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
